.. py:function:: create_coefficient_image(flat_coefficients: numpy.ndarray, image_shape: tuple) -> numpy.ndarray

   Given a set of coefficients that should apply for every pixel,
       converts them to the required coefficient_image format.

   :param flat_coefficients: A one-dimensional list of coefficients that should apply to every pixel in the image.
                             Coefficients should be ordered from the highest power to lowest as expected in `photometric_calibration`, e.g.
                             f(i,j) = a+b*IMG[i,j]+c*IMG[i,j]^2 would have flat_coefficients of [c, b, a]
   :type flat_coefficients: np.ndarray
   :param image_shape: A tuple of the shape of the image that will be calibrated using `photometric_calibration`
   :type image_shape: tuple

   :rtype: An image of coefficients that apply to every pixel as expected by `photometric_calibration`


.. py:function:: photometric_calibration(image: numpy.ndarray, coefficient_image: numpy.ndarray) -> numpy.ndarray

   Computes a non-linear photometric callibration of PUNCH images

   Each instrument is subject to an independent non-linear photometric response,
   which needs to be corrected. The module converts from raw camera digitizer
   number (DN) to photometric units at each pixel. Each pixel is replaced with
   the corresponding value of the quartic polynomial in the current CF data
   product for that particular camera.

   A quartic polynomial is applied as follows:
       X[i,j]=a[i,j]+b[i,j]*DN[i,j]+c[i,j]*DN[i,j]^2+d[i,j]*DN[i,j]^3+e[i,j]*DN[i,j]^4
   for each pixel in the detector. Where each quantity (a, b, c, d, e) is a function
   of pixel location [i,j], and is generated using dark current and Stim lamp
   maps. Where:
       - a = offset (dark and the bias).
       - b, b, c, d, e = higher order terms.
       Specifically coefficient_image[i,j,:] = [e, d, c, b, a] (highest order terms first)

   As each pixel is independent, a quartic fit calibration file (CF) of
   dimensions 2k*2k*5 is constructed, with each layer containing one of the five
   polynomial coefficients for each pixel.

   :param image: Image to be corrected.
   :type image: np.ndarray
   :param coefficient_image: Frame containing uncertainty values.
                             The first two dimensions are the spatial dimensions of the image.
                             The last dimension iterates over the powers of the coefficients. Starting with index 0 being the highest power
                             and counting down.
   :type coefficient_image: np.ndarray

   :returns: a photometrically corrected frame
   :rtype: np.ndarray
