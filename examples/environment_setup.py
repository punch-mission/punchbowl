# To run the sample notebooks contained within punchbowl, you must first create a Python environment.

# If using an environment for running Jupyter notebooks (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc), this environment setup may be handled automatically or through UI prompts on notebook execution.

# To set up manually, start within a terminal, and navigate to the directory in which you want to work with notebooks.

# python -m venv .venv

# source .venv/bin/activate

# pip install requirements.txt
